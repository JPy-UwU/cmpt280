Que. 2 -> log n

Que. 3 -> n^2 log n

Que. 4 -> treeQuestLog. Since checking keys stored in treeQuestLog is not required, it becomes much more efficient than
          hashQuestLog because toString() iterates through tree inOrder.

Que. 5 -> hashQuestLog. Since we can just call keys() and then iterate through them, without needing to search.
